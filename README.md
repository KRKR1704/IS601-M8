## Task Description

This project implements an **Advanced FastAPI-based Calculator Application** designed as part of the **IS601 - Module 8 Assignment**.  
The application supports arithmetic operations through REST API endpoints and includes **comprehensive testing**, **logging**, and **CI/CD automation**.

### Key Features
- FastAPI-based backend for calculator operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and Power).
- Organized codebase with modular structure (`app/` directory).
- Unit tests for each function in `operations.py`.
- Integration tests for API endpoints in `main.py`.
- End-to-End (E2E) testing using **Playwright**.
- Logging integrated across the application to capture both successful operations and errors.
- **Continuous Integration** via **GitHub Actions** to run automated tests on every push.
- Dockerized setup for consistent deployment and execution.

### Run with Docker (Build Locally)
If you want to build the image yourself:
```bash
docker build -t is601_m8 .
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 is601_m8
```

---

## Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)

The repository includes a `.github/workflows/tests.yml` file that:
- Runs all **unit, integration, and Playwright tests** on each push.
- Ensures **test coverage** is maintained.
- Provides feedback directly in the GitHub Actions dashboard.

You can view the workflow runs under:  
[GitHub Actions â€” IS601-M8](https://github.com/KRKR1704/IS601-M8/actions)

---

## Logging

The application uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `logging` module for:
- Operation tracking
- Error reporting
- Debugging test outcomes

Log files are configured in `app/logger.py`.
